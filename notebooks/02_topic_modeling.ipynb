    "This notebook documents the **Topic Modeling pipeline for the debates dataset** for the BSc thesis:  \n",
    "`Debates, Media, and Discourse: A Computational Analysis of Temporal Shifts in U.S. Presidential Debates and Media Framing Across the Political Spectrum`, written by **Emma Cristina Mora** (emma.mora@studbocconi.it) at **Bocconi University** under the supervision of **Professor Carlo Rasmus Schwarz**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook develops a **multi-stage pipeline** for analyzing the thematic structure of U.S. presidential debates (1960–2020). The objective is to identify both **broad political themes** and **finer-grained subcomponents** using hierarchical topic modeling. The process combines unsupervised clustering, manual labeling, and structured exports to create an enriched dataset that serves as input for framing, sentiment, and ideological analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Preparation**\n",
    "- Debate transcripts were first parsed into **utterance-level units** with metadata.\n",
    "- Preprocessing included **speaker normalization** (e.g., unifying “MR. OBAMA” → `Obama`), **noise removal** (applause, laughter, ultra-short moderator remarks), and **metadata enrichment** (`debate_id`, `cycle`, `party`, `decade`).\n",
    "- Final cleaned dataset: ~6,300 utterances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding and Theme Modeling**\n",
    "- Each utterance was embedded with **SBERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**, producing a 6,300 × 384 matrix.\n",
    "- **BERTopic** was applied to discover coarse-grained **themes** (17 categories) using UMAP + HDBSCAN.\n",
    "- Manual relabeling ensured interpretability; incoherent clusters were reassigned or collapsed into `noise_or_unspecified`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Subthemes**\n",
    "- A second round of BERTopic was run within large themes (≥200 utterances) to identify **subthemes**.  \n",
    "- Example results:  \n",
    "  - *foreign_policy_national_security* → 12 subthemes (`russia_soviet_union`, `military_budget`, …)  \n",
    "  - *healthcare_social_security* → 4 subthemes (`affordable_care_health_insurance`, `medicare_prescription_drugs`, …)  \n",
    "  - *tax_policy* → 2 subthemes (`tax_cuts_policy_proposals`, `tax_burden_fairness_inequality`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**\n",
    "- `debates_df_topic.csv` — utterance-level dataset with `theme_name` and `subtheme_name` labels  \n",
    "- `debates_embeddings.npy` — SBERT embedding matrix  \n",
    "- `topics_summary.csv` and `subtopics_summary.csv` — descriptive cluster overviews  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Contribution**\n",
    "This pipeline produces the **core debate dataset** used in downstream analyses, enabling:  \n",
    "- Tracking of theme/subtheme frequency across time  \n",
    "- Sentiment and stance analysis within themes  \n",
    "- Framing and omission analysis in relation to media coverage  \n",
    "- Embedding-based ideological scaling"
